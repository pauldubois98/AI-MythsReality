# Intelligence artificielle : mythes et réalités

what is ai?
=> smth that behaves/mimics like human; some are v stupid, some v smart
ofc, we are more interested in the "smart" ones

AI can be done in various ways:
- classical: tell computer what to do (if this do that, etc...)
- deep: let the computer deduce by himself what is the best behaviors
=> Today, we will try to understand how computers can "learn by themself"
